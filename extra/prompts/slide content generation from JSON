   - Markdown title level 1: "# SLIDE [number]"

   - The activity's objective ("objectifActivite")
   - The trainer's tasks ("aFaireFormateur")

   - The overall module description and training context

3. **Content characteristics:**
   - Concise and scannable
   - Professional and pedagogically sound
   - Appropriate for the activity duration
   - Practical examples relevant to the audience
   - Clear key takeaways

4. **Language:** Use UK English. Use "pupil" instead of "student".
