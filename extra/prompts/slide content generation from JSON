**Task:** Read the attached JSON file containing a learning scenario. Complete and revise all empty or insufficiently detailed "presentation" fields in the activity containers.

**What "presentation" means:** The actual slide deck content that participants will see on screen during each activity - concise, visually friendly slides with titles, bullet points, and key information (NOT detailed facilitator notes or talking points).

**Requirements for slide content:**

1. **Format:** Present each slide clearly with:
   - Markdown title level 1: "# SLIDE [number] - Title: [slide title]"
   - Bullet points, key terms, visual cues (→, ✓, ⚠️, etc.)

2. **Alignment:** Each presentation must align with:
   - The activity's Description ()   
   - The activity's objective ("objectifActivite")
   - The trainer's tasks ("aFaireFormateur")
   - The participant's tasks ("aFaire")
   - Any referenced materials ("liensReferences", "notes")
   - The overall module description and training context

3. **Content characteristics:**
   - Concise and scannable
   - Professional and pedagogically sound
   - Appropriate for the activity duration
   - Clear key takeaways

4. **Language:** Use the same language as in the JSON content.

**Deliverable:** Generate the complete updated JSON file for download.

**Process:**
1. First, ask which module(s) to cover.
2. Complete all relevant "presentation" fields.
3. **Validate the structure:** Before generating the final JSON, validate that the structure matches the original file's schema (all fields, hierarchy, data types, and nested objects preserved).
4. Generate the updated JSON file.
5. Generate a Markdown file listing all the modifications made.
