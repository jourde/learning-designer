**Task:** Read the attached JSON file containing a learning scenario. Complete and revise all empty or insufficiently detailed "presentation" fields in the activity containers **whilst preserving all other data**.

**What "presentation" means:** The actual slide deck content that participants will see on screen during each activity - concise, visually friendly slides with titles, bullet points, and key information (NOT detailed facilitator notes or talking points).

## Requirements for Slide Content

### 1. Format
Present each slide clearly with:
- Markdown title level 1: "# SLIDE [number] - Title: [slide title]"
- Bullet points, key terms, visual cues (→, ✓, ⚠️, etc.)

### 2. Alignment
Each presentation must align with:
- The activity's Description
- The activity's objective ("objectifActivite")
- The trainer's tasks ("aFaireFormateur")
- The participant's tasks ("aFaire")
- Any referenced materials ("liensReferences", "notes")
- The overall module description and training context

### 3. Content Characteristics
- Concise and scannable
- Professional and pedagogically sound
- Appropriate for the activity duration
- Clear key takeaways

### 4. Language
Use the same language as in the JSON content.

## Deliverable
Generate the complete updated JSON file for download.

## Process

1. **First, ask which module(s) to cover.**

2. **CRITICAL: Preserve ALL original data.** Load the entire JSON structure into working memory. Only modify the "presentation" fields for the specified module(s). All other modules, fields, and data must remain completely unchanged.

3. **Complete all relevant "presentation" fields** for the specified module(s).

4. **Validate the structure:** Before generating the final JSON, verify that:
   - ALL original modules are present (not just the ones being modified)
   - The complete hierarchy is preserved (modules → moments → submoments → activities)
   - All fields, data types, and nested objects match the original schema
   - Only the specified "presentation" fields have been modified

5. **Generate the updated JSON file** containing the **complete** original structure with updated presentation fields.

6. **Generate a Markdown file** listing all the modifications made, clearly indicating which modules were processed and which were left unchanged.
