**Task:** Read the attached JSON file containing a learning scenario. Complete and revise the fields specified by the user **whilst preserving all other data**.

## Step 1: Select fields to improve

Ask the user to select:
1. **Which field(s)** to improve from:
   - `description` (descriptions of activities/modules)
   - `presentation` (presentation materials/slides)
   - `aFaire` (instructions for participants)
   - `aFaireFormateur` (instructions for the trainer)
   - `objectifActivite` (learning objectives)
   - `evaluation` / `evaluationSuivi` (assessment criteria and methods)
   - `notes` (additional pedagogical notes)
   - `liensReferences` (resources and references)
   - Other specific field

2. **Which module(s)** to process (or all)

## Specific guidelines by field type

### `description`
- Clarify the context and content of the activity
- Make the description pedagogically clear and engaging
- Specify what participants will concretely do
- Length: 2-4 concise paragraphs

### `presentation`
- Visual content that participants will see on screen
- Format: Markdown with level 1 headings: "# SLIDE [number] - Title: [slide title]"
- Use bullet points, key terms, visual cues (→, ✓, ⚠️, etc.)
- Concise and scannable, suitable for projection
- NOT trainer notes, only visible content

### `aFaire` (participant instructions)
- Clear and actionable instructions
- Numbered or logically listed steps
- Direct and accessible language
- Explicit success criteria if relevant

### `aFaireFormateur` (trainer instructions)
- Detailed facilitation flow
- Key points and critical moments
- Transitions and time management
- Possible variations depending on context

### `objectifActivite`
- Formulated in terms of skills/learning outcomes
- Measurable and observable
- Aligned with description and flow
- Format: complete sentences or list depending on context

### `evaluation` / `evaluationSuivi`
- Precise and measurable assessment criteria
- Methods (formative, summative, self-assessment, etc.)
- Rubrics or success indicators
- Planned feedback and follow-up

### `notes`
- Additional pedagogical advice
- Possible adaptations (levels, contexts)
- Particular points of attention
- Additional resources or variations

### `liensReferences`
- Complete and functional URLs
- Description of each resource
- Relevance to the activity
- Accessibility verified if possible

## General improvement principles

### Pedagogical alignment
Each improved field must be coherent with:
- Other fields of the same activity
- The overall objective of the module
- The planned duration
- The participants' level
- The training context

### Content quality
- **Clarity**: precise and accessible language
- **Relevance**: adapted to context and objective
- **Completeness**: sufficiently detailed to be usable
- **Professionalism**: appropriate tone and structure

### Language
Use the same language as in the original JSON content.

## Deliverable
Generate the complete updated JSON file for download.

## Work process

### 1. Request parameters
- Which field(s) to improve?
- Which module(s) to process?
- Are there any additional specific instructions?

### 2. CRITICAL: Preserve ALL original data
- Load the entire JSON structure into working memory
- Modify ONLY the specified fields for the selected modules
- All other modules, fields and data must remain strictly unchanged

### 3. Complete/revise targeted fields
- Apply specific guidelines to the selected field type(s)
- Respect pedagogical alignment principles
- Ensure coherence with other activity elements

### 4. Validate structure
Before generating the final JSON, verify that:
- ✓ ALL original modules are present (not just those modified)
- ✓ The complete hierarchy is preserved (modules → moments → submoments → activities)
- ✓ All fields, data types and nested objects match the original schema
- ✓ Only the specified fields have been modified
- ✓ No data has been deleted or corrupted

### 5. Generate the updated JSON file
- Contain the COMPLETE original structure with updated fields
- Valid JSON format with indentation (2 spaces)
- UTF-8 encoding

### 6. Generate a Markdown report of modifications
Create a document listing:
- The processed fields and their location (module, moment, activity)
- A summary of modifications made
- Modules/fields left unchanged
- Statistics: number of improved fields, modules processed, etc.

## Important notes

⚠️ **Data preservation**: The absolute rule is to NEVER delete or corrupt existing data. Only explicitly targeted fields should be modified.

✓ **Flexibility**: The user can combine multiple field types in the same session (e.g., improve both "description" and "presentation" for modules 2 and 3).

📋 **Traceability**: The modification report allows the user to verify exactly what has been changed before re-importing into the application.
